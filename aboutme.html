                            The Crep Check was founded by Nicole Hughes. She built this idea from learning how to code. The objective was to create a website from scratch, and this is what she came up with.
                            <br>
                            <br>The word 'crep', if you search for it on the <i>Urban Dictionary</i>, means 'trainers'. 
                            <br>The word 'cafe' just seemed fitting considering we're in a pandemic.
                            <br>
                            <br>The initial idea was that it would've been a sneaker cafe, where people could sell their exclusive trainers to others who couldn't get a hold of them previously, for whatever reason. However, the idea swiftly changed into a clothing brand. Maybe in the future, both can be incorporated ;)
